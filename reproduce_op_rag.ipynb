Prepending a single underscore (_) has some support for protecting module variables and functions (linters will flag protected member access). Note that it is okay for unit tests to access protected constants from the modules under test. Prepending a double underscore (__ aka “dunder”) to an instance variable or method effectively makes the variable or method private to its class (using name mangling); we discourage its use as it impacts readability and testability, and isn’t really private. Prefer a single underscore. Place related classes and top-level functions together in a module. Unlike Java, there is no need to limit yourself to one class per module. Use CapWords for class names, but lower_with_under.py for module names. Although there are some old modules named CapWords.py, this is now discouraged because it’s confusing when the module happens to be named after a class.

Prepending a single underscore (_) has some support for protecting module variables and functions (linters will flag protected member access). Note that it is okay for unit tests to access protected constants from the modules under test. Prepending a double underscore (__ aka “dunder”) to an instance variable or method effectively makes the variable or method private to its class (using name mangling); we discourage its use as it impacts readability and testability, and isn’t really private. Prefer a single underscore. Place related classes and top-level functions together in a module. Unlike Java, there is no need to limit yourself to one class per module. Use CapWords for class names, but lower_with_under.py for module names. Although there are some old modules named CapWords.py, this is now discouraged because it’s confusing when the module happens to be named after a class.

      "Pylint is a tool used for finding bugs and style problems in Python source code. It is particularly useful for catching errors that are typically identified by compilers in less dynamic languages like C and C++. While Pylint is not perfect and may occasionally produce incorrect warnings due to Python's dynamic nature, these spurious warnings are generally infrequent. The tool helps identify easy-to-miss errors such as typos or using variables before assignment. Users can suppress inappropriate warnings to ensure that other issues are not obscured, and it is recommended to run Pylint on your code to maintain code quality and consistency.\n"

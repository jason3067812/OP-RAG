## Unofficial Implementation of OP-RAG

This repository contains an **unofficial implementation** of the paper titled *"In Defense of RAG in the Era of Long-Context Language Models"*. The original paper introduces OP-RAG, a novel approach designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly in the context of long-context language models.

For a detailed understanding of the concepts, methodologies, and experimental results, please refer to the original paper available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01666).
